# EastWestAirlines Clustering Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a data science project that performs K-means clustering on the EastWestAirlines frequent flier program dataset to identify customer segments. The goal is to segment passengers based on their mileage history and behavior to support targeted mileage offer strategies.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Based on real business data (company names changed); provided as `EastWestAirlines.xlsx`.
- **Description**: Includes features like `Balance`, `Qual_miles`, `cc1_miles`, `Bonus_miles`, etc., detailing passenger activity in the frequent flier program.
- **Note**: The dataset is included if permitted; otherwise, use a sample or request access from the provider.

## Files
- `EastWestAirlines_Clustering.py`: Python script containing the K-means clustering analysis.
- `Airlines_Clustering_Report.tex`: LaTeX source file for the project report.
- `Airlines_Clustering_Report.pdf`: Generated PDF report (if included).
- `Mean_Balance_by_Cluster.png`: Visualization of mean balance by cluster (if included).
- `README.md`: This file.

## Requirements
- **Python Libraries**: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`
- **LaTeX**: TeX Live or equivalent for compiling the `.tex` file
- **Git**: For version control and uploading to GitHub

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
